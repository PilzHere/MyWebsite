## A few happy updates...
### How did the FZ.se game jam go?
Frag Ztar came in 5th place (broken voting-system?) in the players voting list.
  
Inet, the sponsor of the game jam voted it as their #1 of the games. 

**In conclusion**: My game was voted to the 5th spot, but I won the most cash reward. *Sometimes luck come in different ways!*

I used the cash to buy myself an Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics card. My old one was an Nvidia GTX 970.

### Updated my Github profile
My github profile should now use *Mustache* and I also implemented a *web crawler* to update the readme file with the latest posts from this website.
They should be located near the bottom of the profile text.

### Graduated from school
That's right.

I have graduated as a **Java/JavaScript Developer** from *EC Utbildning* in Malm√∂, Sweden.

It's very exciting and I am really looking forward to it!!
