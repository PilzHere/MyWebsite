I developed this game for the **LibGDX Game Jam 15**, christmas 2020.
It is coded in Java, using the game library LibGDX.

Clearly inspired by **Wolfenstein 3D**, this game is a *First Person Shooter* in which the player can control the view horizontally but not vertically, shoot enemies, pick up items from the ground and open sliding doors.

It was made in a week of time.

If it was not for the deadline, I would have focused on making proper code for the game (some parts are horrible, just to get things working quickly) and add more enemies, items and maps.\
If I were to do this now, I would probably recode the whole game.

The game got attention from the LibGDX community.\
[Raxorg](https://github.com/Raxorg) added new features into the game.\
MindaugasRumsa released a [mobile version](https://mindaugasrumsa.itch.io/ultra-nightmare-mobile) of the game.
