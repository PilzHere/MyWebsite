This game was developed for the **LibGDX Game Jam**, March 2020.
It is coded in Java, using the game library LibGDX.

Inspired by **The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening**, this game is a *Top-down adventure* in which the player has to find weapons, solve puzzles, and collect all items to get the correct ending of the game.\
There is a thermonuclear attack coming, so you have to make sure you grab every item and get into the shelter to survive. The unbelievers are there to stop you.

It was made in a week of time.
