Developed for the **LibGDX Game Jam**, December 2019.
It is coded in Java, using the game library LibGDX.

Inspired by [the spinning world in Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island](https://youtu.be/U8btNneN8ew?t=255), the player controls Santa Claus who has to chop wood from the trees to collect 100 logs. Once 100 logs are collected, Santa can repair the sleigh and escape the angry yetis on the island.

It was made in a week of time.

I really enjoy the look of sprites in a 3D world and had a blast coding this game.\
Some code of the game is horrible *(just make it work)* because of the deadline.

*Here's the timelapse of coding the game*
